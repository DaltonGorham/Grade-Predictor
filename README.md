# This is the module 3 lab Grade Predictor Assignment. 


In this assignment I used a combination of string functions and file reading to retrieve each line within the provided txt file. Where you are given a summary and then a report on the category specified. After any edits are made it will then give you another category summary with the predicted overall class grade and a popup that shows if an assignment has been edited.

 You can manually enter categories in the file by typing in Category: followed by the name and weight:  
 ex. Homework,50
 This example is a category named Homework worth 50% of your grade.

Each assignemnt is listed after with a assignment number follwed by a :
Then follwed by the name,points possible, points earned, and if its completed with 1 or 0.
Each assignment number must be in listed order even beyond each category. 
ex.
1: Exit Ticket,100,80,1
In this example you have an assignment named Exit Ticket, It's worth 100 points, you made an 80 on it, and you have completed it.
